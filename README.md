# Playwright + TypeScript E2E Automation Framework

---

## Introduction (by the author)

This framework is built as a **modern, production-ready end-to-end test automation solution** using **Playwright and TypeScript**.

The project demonstrates **best practices used in real enterprise environments**, including:

- Clean architecture
- Page Object Model (POM)
- Scalable configuration management
- CI/CD pipeline integration
- Parallel execution strategies
- Robust selector strategy
- Secure environment handling

This is **not a demo-only project**, but a **template architecture** that can be used in real-world systems.

---

## Why Playwright + TypeScript?

### Why Playwright?

- Native multi-browser support (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)
- Fast execution engine
- Auto-waiting & stable selectors
- Excellent debugging tools
- Powerful parallel execution model
- Built-in API testing support

### Why TypeScript?

- Strong typing = fewer runtime bugs
- IDE auto-completion
- Safer refactoring
- Enterprise-grade maintainability

---

## Why `testIdAttribute: 'data-test'`?

I configure Playwright to treat `data-test` as the **primary test selector**:

```ts
use: {
  testIdAttribute: 'data-test';
}
```

### Why?

- Designed specifically for automation
- Stable against UI changes
- Independent of styling & layout changes
- Resistant to localization and translations

This follows **Playwright best practice recommendations**.

---

## Locator Strategy Priority

Selectors follow Playwright’s recommended priority:

1. `getByTestId()`
2. `getByRole()`
3. `getByLabel()`
4. `getByPlaceholder()`
5. `getByText()`

`getByText()` is used **only as fallback** due to localization risks.

---

## Why Static Product Data?

SauceDemo uses **static catalog data**, therefore:

- Product names & prices are **hardcoded**
- No backend seeding or dynamic fixtures required

### In real production systems:

- Data seeding APIs
- DB fixtures
- Environment refresh endpoints

would be used instead.

## Installation & Setup (Detailed)

### 1. System Requirements

- Node.js >= 18
- npm >= 9
- Git
- VS Code (recommended)

Check versions:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

---

### 2. Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/playwright-task-solution.git
cd playwright-task-solution
```

---

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

---

### 4. Install Playwright Browsers

```bash
npx playwright install
```

---

### 5. Configure Environment

Copy example file:

```bash
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

Edit `.env.local`:

```
TEST_ENV=qa
BASE_URL_QA=https://www.saucedemo.com
BASE_URL_STAGING=https://www.saucedemo.com
SAUCE_PASSWORD=secret_sauce
```

---

## Environment Handling Logic

```
.env.local  →  config/env.ts  →  playwright.config.ts  →  Tests
```

### Priority Order:

```
GitHub Actions inputs
   ↓
GitHub Secrets
   ↓
.env.local
```

## Available Scripts Explained

| Script                | Description               |
| --------------------- | ------------------------- |
| `npm test`            | Run full regression suite |
| `npm run test:smoke`  | Run smoke tests only      |
| `npm run test:headed` | Run in headed browser     |
| `npm run test:ui`     | Run Playwright UI mode    |
| `npm run test:debug`  | Debug mode                |
| `npm run lint`        | Run ESLint                |
| `npm run format`      | Run Prettier              |
| `npm run report`      | Open HTML report          |

---

## Tagging Strategy

Tags are implemented using Playwright grep:

```ts
test.describe('Login @smoke', () => {});
```

### Example usage:

| Tag           | Purpose             |
| ------------- | ------------------- |
| `@smoke`      | CI fast validation  |
| `@regression` | Full regression     |
| `@critical`   | High priority tests |

---

## GitHub Actions Pipeline Architecture

### Selectable Inputs:

- Environment → `qa / staging`
- Test Type → `smoke / regression`
- Parallel Mode → `none / specs / browsers`

---

### Execution Strategies:

| Mode       | Description            |
| ---------- | ---------------------- |
| `none`     | Sequential execution   |
| `specs`    | Parallel per test file |
| `browsers` | Parallel per browser   |

---

## Parallelization Architecture

### Option 1: By Spec Files

```
Spec 1 → Worker 1
Spec 2 → Worker 2
Spec 3 → Worker 3
```

### Option 2: By Browsers

```
Chromium → Worker 1
Firefox → Worker 2
WebKit → Worker 3
```

---

## Security Best Practices

- Password stored in `.env.local`
- GitHub Secrets for CI
- No credentials committed
- Roles & users separated
